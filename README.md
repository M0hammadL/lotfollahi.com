# Scarches Docs
Below is a five-minute tutorial how to extends and edit the docs. The sections are self-contained and are copied from the tutorials when you first create a new docusaurus page. For more resources, check out the official guide: https://docusaurus.io/docs.  

## What you'll need to run the docs locally

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## 1. Run your site locally

Run the development server:
```bash
cd my-website
npm install
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.

## 2. Create A Page

Add **Markdown or React** files to `src/pages` to create a **standalone page**:

- `src/pages/index.js` → `localhost:3000/`
- `src/pages/foo.md` → `localhost:3000/foo`
- `src/pages/foo/bar.js` → `localhost:3000/foo/bar`

### Create your first Markdown Page

Create a file at src/pages/my-markdown-page.md. It will be available at: 
[http://localhost:3000/my-markdown-page](http://localhost:3000/my-markdown-page).

## 3. Create a Document
Documents are **groups of pages** connected through:

- a **sidebar**
- **previous/next navigation**
- **versioning**

### Create your first Doc

Create a Markdown file at `docs/hello.md`.
A new document is now available at [http://localhost:3000/docs/hello](http://localhost:3000/docs/hello).

### Configure the Sidebar

Docusaurus automatically **creates a sidebar** from the `docs` folder.

Add metadata to customize the sidebar label and position:

```md title="docs/hello.md" {1-4}
---
sidebar_label: 'Hi!'
sidebar_position: 3
---

# Hello

This is my **first Docusaurus document**!
```

## 4. Markdown Features

Docusaurus supports **[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)** and a few **additional features**.

### Front Matter

Markdown documents have metadata at the top called [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/):

```text title="my-doc.md"
// highlight-start
---
id: my-doc-id
title: My document title
description: My document description
slug: /my-custom-url
---
// highlight-end

### Markdown heading

Markdown text with [links](./hello.md)
```

### Links

Regular Markdown links are supported, using url paths or relative file paths.

```md
Let's see how to [Create a page](/create-a-page).
```

```md
Let's see how to [Create a page](./create-a-page.md).
```

**Result:** Let's see how to [Create a page](./create-a-page.md).

### Images

Regular Markdown images are supported.

You can use absolute paths to reference images in the static directory (`static/img/docusaurus.png`):

```md
![Docusaurus logo](/img/docusaurus.png)
```

You can reference images relative to the current file as well. This is particularly useful to colocate images close to the Markdown files using them:

```md
![Docusaurus logo](./img/docusaurus.png)
```

## 5. Deploy your site

Docusaurus is a **static-site-generator** (also called **[Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/)**).

It builds your site as simple **static HTML, JavaScript and CSS files**.

### Build your site

Build your site **for production**:

```bash
npm run build
```

The static files are generated in the `build` folder.

### Deploy your site

Test your production build locally:

```bash
npm run serve
```

The `build` folder is now served at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

You can now deploy the `build` folder **almost anywhere** easily, **for free** or very small cost (read the **[Deployment Guide](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment)**).

## 6. Manage Docs Versions

Docusaurus can manage multiple versions of your docs.

## Create a docs version

Release a version 1.0 of your project:

```bash
npm run docusaurus docs:version 1.0
```

The `docs` folder is copied into `versioned_docs/version-1.0` and `versions.json` is created.

Your docs now have 2 versions:

- `1.0` at `http://localhost:3000/docs/` for the version 1.0 docs
- `current` at `http://localhost:3000/docs/next/` for the **upcoming, unreleased docs**

## Add a Version Dropdown

To navigate seamlessly across versions, add a version dropdown.

Modify the `docusaurus.config.js` file:

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
module.exports = {
  themeConfig: {
    navbar: {
      items: [
        // highlight-start
        {
          type: 'docsVersionDropdown',
        },
        // highlight-end
      ],
    },
  },
};
```

The docs version dropdown appears in your navbar.
## Update an existing version

It is possible to edit versioned docs in their respective folder:

- `versioned_docs/version-1.0/hello.md` updates `http://localhost:3000/docs/hello`
- `docs/hello.md` updates `http://localhost:3000/docs/next/hello`
