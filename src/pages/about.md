# Biography

<p>&nbsp;</p>

I have recently finished my PhD in Computational Biology (summa cum laude) at **[School of Life Sciences](https://www.ls.tum.de/en/ls/home/?/)** at the **[Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/en/)** under supervision of **[Fabian Theis](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/icb/pi/fabian-theis)**.

I am working in the intersection of machine learning (ML) and Biology. I leverage ML to understand health and disease using single-cell biology for drug discovery and cell engineering. Check my **[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=NXhouUcAAAAJ&hl=en)** and **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Mohlotf)** account for the latest updates.

I also have industry experience as a research intern and consultant in both drug discovery companies and machine learning research such as **[Cellarity](https://cellarity.com/)** and **[Facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com/)**.
