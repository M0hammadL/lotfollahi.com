# Biography

I have recently completed my PhD in Computational Biology at the **[Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/en/)** and **[Helmholtz Munich](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/)** under the supervision of **[Fabian Theis](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/icb/pi/fabian-theis)**.
I am also a member of **[ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/)**.

My research focuses on developing AI/ML algorithms for biomedical data, with a specific emphasis on single-cell technologies for diagnostics, therapeutics, and drug discovery. I have received multiple awards for my research (see [example](https://lotfollahi.com/blog/Bayer%20Foundation%20Early%20Excellence%20in%20Science%20Award)) and have been featured in press/journals (see [research](https://lotfollahi.com/research)). Additionally, I have been awarded multiple fellowships, grants, and scholarships, including those from **[Joachim Hertz](https://www.joachim-herz-stiftung.de/en/)**, **[EMBL](https://www.embl.org/)**, and **[Meta](https://about.meta.com/)**.

I have been offered a faculty position directly after my PhD (rare in Biology) at the **[Wellcome Sanger Institute](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/)**, a leading program contributing to the **[Human Cell Atlas](https://www.humancellatlas.org/)** project. As part of this role,
I will be hiring PhD students from the **[University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/)**.

In addition to my academic activities, I have industry experience as a researcher, consultant, and advisor in both biotechnology and ML/AI companies, including:

- **[Cellarity](https://cellarity.com/)**
- **[Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/)**
- **[SANTA ANA Bio](https://www.santaanabio.com/)**
- **[Relation Therapeutics](https://www.relationrx.com/)**
