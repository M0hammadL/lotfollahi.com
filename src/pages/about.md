I am the scientfic co-funder of **[AI VIVO](https://aivivo.co/)** and also member of **[ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/)**. 

We aim to leverage AI and advanced experimental techniques to engineer cells and modulate their response to disease and perturbations and translated them 
for diagnostics, therapeutics, and drug discovery. 

I have received multiple awards for my research (see [example](https://lotfollahi.com/blog/Bayer%20Foundation%20Early%20Excellence%20in%20Science%20Award)) and have been featured in press/journals (see [research](https://lotfollahi.com/research)). Additionally, I have been awarded multiple fellowships, grants, and scholarships, including those from **[Joachim Hertz](https://www.joachim-herz-stiftung.de/en/)**, **[EMBL](https://www.embl.org/)**, **[Meta](https://about.meta.com/)**, **[Open Targets](https://www.opentargets.org/)** and **[Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/). Previously, I completed my PhD in Computational Biology at the **[Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/en/)** and **[Helmholtz Munich](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/)** under the supervision of **[Fabian Theis](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/icb/pi/fabian-theis)**.


In addition to my academic activities, I have industry experience as a researcher, consultant, and advisor in both biotechnology and ML/AI companies, including:
