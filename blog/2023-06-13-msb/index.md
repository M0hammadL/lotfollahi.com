I am excited that our work from my time at Meta AI and collaboration with Helmholtz Munich on modeling single-cell perturbations (e.g., drugs, disease, CRISPR manipulations) is now featured on the cover of Molecular systems biology. 
Thanks to all collaborators and my co-authors for making this happen.
